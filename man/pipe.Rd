\description{
Pipe operators. The simple one with no forcing to \strong{Flow} objects is
\code{\link{\%>.\%}}. \code{\link{\%>+\%}} forces convertion to \strong{Flow} and
automatically manage non-standard evaluation through creation and unquoting
of \strong{quosure}s for named arguments whose name ends with \code{_}.
}
\details{
With \code{\%>.\%}, the value must be explicitly indicated with a
\code{.} inside the expression. The expression is \strong{not} modified, but the value
is first assigned into the calling environment as \code{.} (warning! possibly
replacing any existing value... do \strong{not} use \code{.} to name other objects).
Also the expression is saved as \code{.call} in the calling environment so that
\code{debug_flow()} can retrieve are rerun it easily. If a \strong{Flow} object is used
with \code{\%>.\%}, the \code{.value} is extracted from it into \code{.}first (and thus
the \strong{Flow} object is lost).

In the case of \code{\%>+\%} the \strong{Flow} object passed or created, it is
also assigned in the calling environment as \code{..}. This can be used to refer
to \strong{Flow} object content within the pipeline expressions.

For \code{\%>+\%}, the expression is reworked like this. First, \code{++} is
interpreted as "get from the \strong{Flow} object, or inherited environment, and
unquote expression"; \code{..} is interpreted as "get from the \strong{Flow} object
without inheritage and unquote expression", and finally, if the expression
starts by calling a regular function name, without specifying \code{.} as first
argument, it is added. The raw expression is saved as \code{.call_raw}, while the
reworked call is saved as \code{.call} for possible further inspection and
debugging.

Finally, for \code{\%>+\%}, if \code{expr} is \code{.}, then, the last value from the
pipe is extracted from the \strong{Flow} object and returned. It is equivalent,
thus, to \code{flow_obj$.value}.
